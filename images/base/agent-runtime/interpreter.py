"""
The agent-runtime IR interpreter (Approach A — a GENERIC IR INTERPRETER, not a
second compiler). The TypeScript ``compile()`` in os-ui is the single source of
graph semantics; it emits the IR (JSON) and POSTs it here. This module maps the
IR to a ReAct-style graph walk and runs it, mirroring os-ui
``lib/agents/build/run-graph.ts`` EXACTLY:

  * walk from ``entrypoint`` (BFS over a queue, visited-set so no node runs twice)
  * for each visited node: call the MODEL once, then make ONE governed tool call
    per tool in ``node.tools``
  * a supervisor fans out to its members and sets reachedEnd (the router always
    includes END); follow handoff ``commands`` (from -> to); a leaf reaches END
  * SKIP any node id in ``disabledAgents``
  * ``recursionLimit`` bounds the number of node visits; ``timeoutMs`` bounds
    wall-clock — either stops the walk but still reports what ran

A HAND-ROLLED BFS was chosen over a real LangGraph ``StateGraph`` so the walk is
fully deterministic and hermetic in pytest (no graph-engine scheduling, no
network), while still faithfully replicating run-graph.ts.

The model client and the governed-tool HTTP call are INJECTED (``model_call`` /
``tool_call`` callables) so the whole interpreter runs without network in tests.
Real default implementations (LiteLLM via the OpenAI-compatible client and the
os-ui governed-tool endpoint) are built by the factories below and lazily import
their deps, keeping this module's import side-effect-free.

Security posture (security.md): retrieved/tool/user context is DATA, never
instructions — the system prompt says so explicitly (prompt-injection defense),
mirroring images/sample-agent/app.py's SYSTEM_PROMPT.
