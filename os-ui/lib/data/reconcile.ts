/**
 * The governed RECONCILE SWEEP behind `reconcileDomainTables` — the SELF-HEAL for the
 * recurring "domain gold table not materialized" drift (#96 / #151, the Northpeak class).
 *
 * A promoted dataset's registry says tier=asset + queryable + cube.ready, but the physical
 * Iceberg table `iceberg.<domain>.gold_<slug>` has drifted out of the warehouse (a
 * catalog/warehouse event, or a demote→re-promote round-trip), and NO `domainTableStale`
 * flag was set — so the OS believes it is fine and every dashboard dead-ends. The sweep
 * PROBES each promoted domain table the operator governs; when it is MISSING (or already
 * flagged STALE), it re-runs the SAFE stored publish CTAS via {@link rematerializeDomainTable}
 * (preserves grain + measures — it re-runs the stored plan, never reconstructs), re-probes,
 * and clears the flag. Best-effort per dataset: one failure never aborts the sweep, and the
 * honest error rides in the per-dataset report.
 *
 * Pure module: the governed dataset list, the physical probe and the re-materialize are all
 * INJECTED, so the decision (missing→refresh, stale→refresh, ok→skip), the report shape and
 * the governance gate are unit-testable against fakes — no cluster required.
