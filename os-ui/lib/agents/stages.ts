/**
 * The AGENTS guided path as a shared-core staged model — Define · Grant · Design ·
 * Build · Run · Evaluate. Pure and framework-free (mirrors the Software `SW_STAGES`
 * array) so the gating and ✓ rules are unit-testable on their own; the React skin is
 * components/agents/SimpleBuilder.tsx, riding components/core/StageShell.tsx.
 *
 * This is a SIX-stage flow: the previously-merged "Build & Run" is split back into a
 * dedicated Build (compile + verify) and Run (run + live progress + results + per-node
 * drill-down) stage, so each stage does one job. The trigger mode lives in Define now
 * (it's part of defining the team), not next to Run.
 *
 * INTERNAL STAGE IDS ARE KEPT STABLE where load-bearing (the OS scope-vocabulary pattern):
 *   `define` / `grant` / `design` / `build` / `evaluate` ids are UNCHANGED. The `run` id is
 *   RESTORED between build and evaluate. Any inbound legacy string still resolves via
 *   {@link aliasStageId} so a saved session position, a deep-link or an assistant `stage`
 *   verb never lands on a dead id.
 *
 * `enabled(ctx)` gates which stages are reachable off REAL system state — Grant opens once
 * the team is named, Design is always reachable, Build is gated on a runnable team (≥1 agent
 * AND an entrypoint), Run is gated on a green build, and Evaluate is blocked until a run
 * exists. `completed(ctx)` is each stage's LIVE condition; a stage shows a ✓ only when the
 * user ALSO worked it this session (tracked by the StageState in the component) — so a
 * freshly-opened system shows no pre-marked checks.
