/**
 * GROUNDED TEAM PROPOSER — the auto-team-proposer behind the Agents Design stage's
 * "propose a team" action. It is a GROUNDED SUPERSET of the free-form scaffolder in
 * `assistant.ts` (`scaffoldSystem`): same three-step pipeline —
 *
 *   assistantComplete → parseProposedAgents (validate/repair/cap 8, reject <2)
 *                     → scaffoldFromProposal (deterministic role-floor tool assignment,
 *                       linear handoff wiring, entrypoint)
 *
 * — but the planner prompt is EXTENDED with a CONTEXT block listing the deliverable (the
 * system description), the declared outputs, and the GRANTED resource NAMES (data /
 * knowledge / connections / metrics / plan) plus the granted TOOL POOL. So the proposed
 * roles reference REAL granted assets, never ungranted ones. The context NAMES are
 * resolved by the caller (the route) through the SAME DLS/RLS-scoped grants listers the
 * grants picker uses — this module never touches the caller's whole catalog.
 *
 * It RETURNS the proposed {@link System} WITHOUT persisting it; the client commits it
 * through the existing governed path (the system.yaml write). The LLM call is injected so
 * the unit test is hermetic (no gateway).
 *
 * SAFETY (inherited from `scaffoldFromProposal`): the LLM proposes STRUCTURE only — it
 * never names tools. Tools are derived deterministically per agent by `suggest-tools`,
 * intersected with the caller's role-floor `toolCatalog`, so the scaffold can never grant
 * above the caller's floor and always passes the narrow-only compiler check.
