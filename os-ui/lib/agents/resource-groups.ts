/**
 * The two labelled SECTIONS of the Simple builder's "What your team can use" grant
 * panel, matching the OS information architecture:
 *
 *   ① Plan Items   — Strategy · Big Bets · Operating Model · Workflows
 *   ② Context      — Knowledge · Files · Data · Connections · Metrics
 *
 * Workflows is its OWN member of Plan Items, SEPARATE from Knowledge (they were
 * historically conflated because a workflow id `wf_…` shares the `grants.knowledge`
 * list with knowledge docs `pk_…`; the two sections keep them visually distinct and
 * route each to the correct grant channel — see `resourceKindGrantField`).
 *
 * Each member names the underlying GRANTABLE mechanism:
 *   • `field`  — the `system.grants` key its per-item grants land in (when wireable).
 *   • `feedKind` — the `…/grants/available?kind=` feed to browse (when wireable).
 *   • `wireable` — every Plan-item kind (Strategy · Big Bets · Operating Model) and
 *                  every Context kind is now a real per-item picker; `false` is reserved
 *                  for any future kind that lacks a scoped available feed, which would
 *                  surface as a labelled, explained placeholder rather than inventing a
 *                  grant channel that doesn't exist server-side.
 *
 * PURE + client-safe — the SimpleBuilder UI and the unit tests share this ONE list.
