 *      {@link convergence} proves they yield the identical Measure + member, so the
 *      define UX can offer all three without ever forking the definition.
 *   2. RESOLVE-time agreement: the explorer, Superset dashboards and the agent `metrics`
 *      tool all read the SAME canonical member. {@link numbersMatch} proves that, for a
 *      member, every consumer returns the identical value (the kind-gate "numbers
 *      match the agent's metrics tool" check, at the unit level).
 *
 * {@link consistencyCheck} is the promotion gate's content (the spec's open question):
 * a metric may only be promoted/certified when it is documented AND resolves AND every
 * consumer would resolve the same member. Pure + tested.
