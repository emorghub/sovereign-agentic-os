# Knowledge — golden path

## Where things live now

The Plan section splits this into three sibling tabs — don't conflate them:

- **Workflows** is its own tab. The authored, step-by-step "how work gets done"
  records (steps · actors · rules · tacit) live there and are the subject of the
  `author_knowledge` / `index_knowledge` / `publish_knowledge` loop below.
- **Operating Manual** is its own tab with three scopes — **My · Domain · Company** —
  for the durable policy/handbook prose (get · update · list-versions · restore per
  scope), separate from workflows.
- **Knowledge** is now **reference-only**: the canonical, searchable, RLS-scoped
  knowledge store you read from (`search_knowledge` · `list_knowledge` ·
  `get_knowledge`) to ground agents. Authoring still flows through this surface's
  `author_knowledge`, but the browsing home for the workflow records is the
  Workflows tab.

## What this is

The knowledge store is the OS's canonical store for how work gets done. A
workflow holds these kinds of content that complement each other:

- **steps** — ordered sequence of actions, each owned by an actor, with inputs,
  outputs, and an optional per-step inline tacit note.
- **actors** — the workflow's first-class actor registry. Each actor is a described
  entity (name · category · description) in one of five categories: **Human ·
  Software · Agent · Customer · Partner**. Customer and Partner are *external*
  (outside the organisation) and render as visually distinct swimlane lanes. Steps
  reference actors from this registry; omit `actors` and one is derived from the
  steps' distinct (category, name) pairs automatically.
- **rules** — guardrails (`hard: true` = must-not-violate; `hard: false` = soft
  guideline). Both workflow-level and step-level rules are supported.
- **tacit** — unstructured know-how that resists formalization: the gotchas, the
  "why behind the why", institutional memory, cultural nuances. Tacit lives in two
  places: a short **per-step** note (`steps[].tacit`) and a longer **workflow-level**
  `tacit` string (the sibling TACIT.md). Both are indexed as separate retrieval units.

Knowledge grounds agents — an agent system without published knowledge is
operating blind. In the cross-tab spine, knowledge feeds directly into the Agents
tab.

## How to build it

1. **Dedupe first.** Call `search_knowledge` with the concept you plan to capture.
   If a relevant workflow exists, call `get_knowledge` and extend it rather than
   authoring a duplicate. Call `list_knowledge` to browse by domain.

2. **Author.** Call `author_knowledge` with the real params (see below). The tool
   creates a My-scope draft (yours, no approval) — a single `workflow.md` in the
   governed store.

3. **Index.** Call `index_knowledge` to chunk, embed, and make the workflow
   retrievable via semantic search. This step is required before the workflow
   appears in `search_knowledge` results.

4. **Verify.** Call `search_knowledge` with a phrase drawn from the workflow body
   or its tacit content. Confirm it surfaces in the top results. This closes the
   authoring loop.

5. ⛔ **Domain admin publishes.** A domain admin (or tenant admin) calls
   `publish_knowledge` to promote the workflow from My to Domain. Published
   workflows are visible to domain members and can be referenced by agent systems.

**Note:** `search_knowledge` hits carry provenance metadata (author, domain, tier).
Always cite the source when you relay knowledge to a user.

## `author_knowledge` — real params

```
author_knowledge({
  title:    string,          // required — e.g. "Refund handling"
  domain:   string?,         // one of your domains; defaults to your first
  markdown: string?,         // optional free prose body (context, background)
  steps: [                   // ordered steps
    {
      title:      string,    // required
      actor:      "Human" | "Software" | "Agent" | "Customer" | "Partner",
                             // Customer + Partner are EXTERNAL actors
      actor_name: string?,   // e.g. "Loan Officer"; matches actors[].name
      inputs:     string[],  // artefacts consumed
      outputs:    string[],  // artefacts produced
      tacit:      string?,   // per-step inline note — gotchas, edge cases,
                             // undocumented nuances for THIS step
    }
  ],
  actors: [                  // optional actor registry (else derived from steps)
    {
      name:        string,   // required — e.g. "Salesforce API"
      category:    "Human" | "Software" | "Agent" | "Customer" | "Partner",
      description: string?,  // its role — applies to EVERY category, e.g.
                             // "Salesforce API — nightly REST ingestion"
    }
  ],
  rules: [                   // workflow-level decision rules
    { text: string, hard: boolean }
  ],
  tacit: string?,            // workflow-level tacit doc — unstructured know-how
                             // that applies to the whole workflow (gotchas, cultural
                             // notes, the "why"). Markdown headings split it into
                             // separately-retrievable chunks. Per-step notes go in
                             // steps[].tacit instead.
})
```

### How tacit knowledge is stored and indexed

- **`steps[].tacit`** — stored as a `> tacit:` blockquote in `workflow.md`
  immediately after the step's fenced block. Chunked as a `tacit` unit with the
  step's provenance (actor, step_id). Trust = visibility − 0.05; authority = 0.5.
- **`tacit` (workflow-level)** — stored as a sibling `TACIT.md`. Markdown headings
  split it into separately-retrievable chunks so large tacit docs don't collapse
  into a single opaque blob. Trust = visibility − 0.05; authority = 0.55.
- Both are indexed by `index_knowledge` and surface in `search_knowledge` results
  with `type: "tacit"` provenance.

## What to consider

- **Search before authoring.** Duplicate knowledge fragments the canonical record.
  A `search_knowledge` call with a broad query is cheap; a duplicate article is
  expensive to reconcile later.
- **Actor fidelity matters.** Steps with incorrect actor types (e.g. marking an
  automated step as Human) mislead agents that consume the knowledge.
- **Index is not automatic.** `author_knowledge` creates a draft record;
  `index_knowledge` makes it findable. Missing this step means agents will not
  retrieve the workflow.
- **Hard rules are enforced.** When an agent system ingests published knowledge,
  `hard: true` rules are applied as constraints. Set this flag deliberately.
- **Tacit is a first-class citizen, not a hack.** Use `steps[].tacit` for inline
  per-step notes. Use the top-level `tacit` string for workflow-wide gotchas.
  Never hand-embed `> tacit:` blockquotes in the raw `markdown` param — use the
  structured fields so the chunker can index them properly.
- **Provenance must be cited.** Do not paraphrase or strip attribution from
  knowledge hits. The OS traces which knowledge grounded which agent action.

## Governance

| Step | Role required |
|---|---|
| `search_knowledge`, `list_knowledge`, `get_knowledge` | Creator |
| `author_knowledge`, `index_knowledge` | Creator (own work) |
| `retire_knowledge` (archive/delete) | Creator (own My-scope); domain admin+ for a Domain workflow |
| ⛔ `publish_knowledge` | Domain admin (or tenant admin) |

`retire_knowledge` is lineage-aware: retiring a workflow still consumed by an App
or Agent system is blocked (409) — remove those uses first. `action: "delete"` is
physical + irreversible (purges the index) and refuses a still-published workflow;
`action: "archive"` (default) is a reversible soft-hide.

OPA enforces domain scope. Unpublished workflows are My-scope and invisible to
agents. A creator cannot publish their own knowledge — file the workflow and hand
off to a domain admin.

**Worked example (with tacit):**

```
search_knowledge({ query: "how to reconcile invoice exceptions", domain: "finance" })
→ [] — no existing workflow

author_knowledge({
  title: "Invoice exception reconciliation",
  domain: "finance",
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Pull flagged invoices",
      actor: "Software",
      outputs: ["Flagged invoice list"],
      tacit: "The ERP export misses invoices created before 9 AM on the same day — run it after 10 AM."
    },
    {
      title: "Review and resolve",
      actor: "Human",
      inputs: ["Flagged invoice list"],
      actor_name: "Finance Analyst"
    }
  ],
  rules: [{ text: "Exceptions > 10 000 EUR need CFO sign-off", hard: true }],
  tacit: "## Seasonal note\nVolume spikes 3× in December — request extra headcount by Nov 15.\n\n## System quirk\nThe ERP auto-closes exceptions older than 90 days without notification."
})
→ { id: "wf_04F...", status: "draft", visibility: "My" }

index_knowledge({ workflowId: "wf_04F..." })
→ { workflow: { unitCount: 6 }, domain: { unitCount: 1 } }

search_knowledge({ query: "reconcile invoice exceptions" })
→ [{ id: "wf_04F...", score: 0.94, provenance: { type: "workflow", author: "alex@..." } },
   { id: "wf_04F...:tacit:doc:0", score: 0.87, provenance: { type: "tacit" } }]
```

A domain admin then calls `publish_knowledge({ workflowId: "wf_04F..." })` to make
it available to agents.
