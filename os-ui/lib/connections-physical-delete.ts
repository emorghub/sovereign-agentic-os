/**
 * PHYSICAL cleanup for a connection DELETE (never for archive — archive is a reversible
 * registry-only soft-hide; the vault secret + OAuth token are KEPT so a restore
 * reconnects with no re-auth).
 *
 * THE ONE RULE is that the credential lives in the VAULT (`lib/secrets`), never in the
 * record — so deleting the record alone leaves a live credential (and, for OAuth
 * connections, a usable access/refresh token) behind in Secrets Manager. That is a
 * "deleted" connection whose secret can still be injected. DELETE must therefore PURGE
 * the vault:
 *
 *   • `c.secretRef` — the credential AND (for a Drive/Notion OAuth connection) the stored
 *     token set, which `storeTokens` writes under the SAME ref. Deleting it forgets/
 *     revokes the token locally (the token can no longer be resolved or refreshed).
 *   • `{ name: c.secretRef.name, key: 'mcp-client' }` — a Notion hosted-MCP connection
 *     ALSO stores its registered OAuth client under a sibling key; purge it too.
 *
 * Archive keeps every vault entry. Pure planning + injected `deleteSecret`, so the plan
 * and the honest report fold are unit-testable without a vault; the store injects the
 * real `deleteSecret`. Mirrors `lib/data/physical-delete`.
