 * lives in `lib/apps.ts`; this module carries the NEW governed surfaces the
 * 2026-06-30 golden path adds on top of the existing create/scaffold/promote
 * base — the deploy state machine, the Builder review card + security scan, the
 * declared/consumed resource manifest, and the adapter result shapes.
 *
 * Every effectful step the adapters perform reports `mode: 'live' | 'offline-mock'`
 * exactly like `lib/agents/build/server.ts`, so the golden path is honest about
 * what ran against a real cluster vs the in-process teaching fallback.

 * front. An app that serves a frontend / HTML has a `ui`; one that exposes API
 * endpoints or an MCP tool surface has an `api`; an app can have both. The
