/**
 * SCOPE vocabulary + grouping — the ONE artifact-scope model shared across the
 * whole OS. This module is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the words users see
 * when they think about "how far does this reach": every artifact list (Data,
 * Files, Knowledge, Workflows, Agents, Dashboards, Metrics, Big Bets, Software,
 * Connections, Science, Marketplace) slices the caller's visible items into the
 * SAME four groups and labels them with the SAME nouns and verbs.
 *
 *   All      — everything the caller can see (union of the three groups)
 *   My …     — the caller's OWN items (owner), regardless of tier — a
 *              promoted asset they authored still shows under "My"
 *   Domain   — shared to the caller's domain (tier `asset` / visibility Shared)
 *   Company  — certified, cross-domain (tier `product` / visibility Marketplace)
 *
 * VOCABULARY (locked): the scope LABELS are All · My · Domain · Company
 * (e.g. "My Data", "Domain Data", "Company Data"), matching the Strategic
 * Pillars / Operating Manual scopes. The promotion VERBS read "Promote to
 * Domain" (Personal → Shared) and "Certify to Company" (Shared → Certified).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this is a DISPLAY vocabulary only. The internal enum / persisted
 * values are UNCHANGED: `ScopeKey` stays `mine|shared|marketplace`, the store
 * payload stays `{ mine, domain, marketplace }`, and visibility values stay
 * `Personal|Shared|Certified|Marketplace`. Only the human-facing strings below
 * moved from "Shared in Domain"/"Marketplace" to "Domain"/"Company".
 *
 * SEMANTICS are lifted verbatim from the Data tab's `dataset-scopes.ts`:
 *   • the store already returns a canView-scoped `{ mine, domain, marketplace }`
 *     payload (grouped server-side by tier/visibility);
 *   • "All"    = the union of all three groups;
 *   • "My"     = OWNERSHIP — everything in the union whose `owner` is the caller,
 *                so a Domain/Company item the caller authored appears under BOTH
 *                All and My (and also under Domain/Company);
 *   • "Domain" = the `domain` group as returned by the store;
 *   • "Company" = the `marketplace` group as returned by the store.
 *
 * Pure + client-safe (no server-only / Next imports): this only re-slices an
 * already-authz'd payload for DISPLAY. Authz stays in the stores.
