/**
 * Google BigQuery provider — FULLY implemented (Phase 1b). Trino native `bigquery`
 * connector, dataset federation billed against a (optionally distinct) parent project.
 *
 * KEY RULE — no credentials are ever inlined into the props. BigQuery auth has TWO
 * mutually-exclusive branches:
 *
 *   1. Service-account JSON (default when `credentialsSecretRef` is set) — the
 *      customer's SA key JSON is mounted as a FILE from a vault secret and referenced
 *      by path via `bigquery.credentials-file`. The JSON is NEVER inlined into the
 *      properties (Trino also supports `bigquery.credentials-key` as base64, which we
 *      deliberately DO NOT use — a file keeps the secret out of the rendered config).
 *
 *   2. Workload Identity (when `credentialsSecretRef` is omitted) — the Trino pod's
 *      GKE ServiceAccount is bound to a GCP service account, so the Google client
 *      library's Application Default Credentials resolve automatically. We emit NO
 *      `bigquery.credentials-file` line at all; there is no secret material to mount.
 *
 * The integration chart mounts the SA-JSON secret (key `bigquery-sa-json`) at
 * `/etc/trino/secrets/bq-sa.json` — the exact path emitted below.
