 * Composition-map adapter (builds-on-top-of graph).

 * Distinct from the roadmap's build-ORDER dependencies, the composition map is
 * the runtime "builds-on-top-of" picture: which dashboards / agents / software /
 * ML models CONSUME which data products, knowledge, metrics and connections. It
 * is DERIVED from real lineage — the registry's consume-edges plus OpenMetadata
 * lineage (mocked for kind) — never hand-drawn, so it stays true as components
 * change. It doubles as the value-attribution graph: usage-based allocation and
 * upstream credit both ride on these same edges (see value.ts).
 *
 * We include not just a bet's directly-tagged components but the SHARED upstream
 * assets they build on (even if those aren't tagged to the bet) — that is how a
 * data product used by a dashboard + an agent becomes visible and earns credit.
