/**
 * The approval-IS-an-action executor (governance-golden-path.md key principle).
 * On Approve, the platform doesn't just flip a flag — it EXECUTES the governed
 * effect behind the card: deploy the app (Argo), grant access (policy compiler →
 * OPA/DLS), allowlist the endpoint (egress proxy), promote/certify, or run the
 * queued action. The route then writes audit + (optionally) a standing policy.
 *
 * Each effect is a per-source ADAPTER with a live path and an offline-mock path.
 * Unwired backends (Argo, the egress proxy) are mocked for `kind` and clearly
 * marked `live:false`; the policy/access/egress effects mutate the authoritative
 * in-process plane (policy-view) AND best-effort push to OPA, so the consumer
 * truly can query / the endpoint truly is allowlisted in the teaching flow.
