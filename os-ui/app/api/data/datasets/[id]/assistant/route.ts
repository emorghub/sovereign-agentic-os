/**
 * The per-STAGE Data assistant — one governed helper, scoped to the guided stage the user
 * is on (Define · Ingest · Refine · Publish · Use). It runs the SAME ONE assistant model
 * every other built-in helper uses (`assistantComplete`: Langfuse-audited, cost-cap enforced),
 * so it inherits the honest 503 (no model configured) and 402 (cost cap) errors — there is
 * NO fake-AI fallback. The model only SUGGESTS text/JSON; it never mutates a dataset. The
 * client applies suggestions through the normal docs/build/promote paths.
 *
 * The response is always `{ text }` (plain prose) except Define, which asks for a strict JSON
 * `{ description, columns, checks }` draft the client can drop into the Define stage.
 * (Use has no assistant — Talk to Data is its own governed NL→SQL surface.)
